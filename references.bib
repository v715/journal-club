	abstract = {A connectome is a map of the structural and/or functional connections in the brain. This information-rich representation has the potential to transform our understanding of the relationship between patterns in brain connectivity and neurological processes, disorders, and diseases. However, existing computational techniques used to analyze connectomes are often insufficient for interrogating multi-subject connectomics datasets. Several methods are either solely designed to analyze single connectomes, or leverage heuristic graph invariants that ignore the complete topology of connections between brain regions. To enable more rigorous comparative connectomics analysis, we introduce robust and interpretable statistical methods motivated by recent theoretical advances in random graph models. These methods enable simultaneous analysis of multiple connectomes across different scales of network topology, facilitating the discovery of hierarchical brain structures that vary in relation with phenotypic profiles. We validated these methods through extensive simulation studies, as well as synthetic and real-data experiments. Using a set of high-resolution connectomes obtained from genetically distinct mouse strains (including the BTBR mouse -- a standard model of autism -- and three behavioral wild-types), we show that these methods uncover valuable latent information in multi-subject connectomics data and yield novel insights into the connective correlates of neurological phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that the brain's structural and functional networks (i.e., connectomics) can be constructed by various imaging technologies (e.g., EEG/MEG; structural, diffusion and functional MRI) and further characterized by graph theory. Given the huge complexity of network construction, analysis and statistics, toolboxes incorporating these functions are largely lacking. Here, we developed the GRaph thEoreTical Network Analysis (GRETNA) toolbox for imaging connectomics. The GRETNA contains several key features as follows: (i) an open-source, Matlab-based, cross-platform (Windows and UNIX OS) package with a graphical user interface (GUI); (ii) allowing topological analyses of global and local network properties with parallel computing ability, independent of imaging modality and species; (iii) providing flexible manipulations in several key steps during network construction and analysis, which include network node definition, network connectivity processing, network type selection and choice of thresholding procedure; (iv) allowing statistical comparisons of global, nodal and connectional network metrics and assessments of relationship between these network metrics and clinical or behavioral variables of interest; and (v) including functionality in image preprocessing and network construction based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) data. After applying the GRETNA to a publicly released R-fMRI dataset of 54 healthy young adults, we demonstrated that human brain functional networks exhibit efficient small-world, assortative, hierarchical and modular organizations and possess highly connected hubs and that these findings are robust against different analytical strategies. With these efforts, we anticipate that GRETNA will accelerate imaging connectomics in an easy, quick and flexible manner. GRETNA is freely available on the NITRC website.},

The SER experimental setup has the characteristics of batch experiments and provides complete control over the reaction time; in addition, the setup also includes certain simple transport features. We conducted several single-reactor and multiple-reactor SER experiments to investigate arsenic adsorption and transport on iron-oxide coated sand, at different pH, solid-solution ratio, and initial arsenic concentration conditions. The data generated from the experiments are compared against predictions from a geochemical transport code (PHREEQCI) that used previously developed surface complexation model parameters to describe the reaction system. The model predictions matched the SER experimental data well. The proposed SER system provides a flexible alternative to column experiments and allows better control over system parameters such as pH, reaction time, and solid-solution ratio.},

              Background
              Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) dramatically increases the risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). Several studies have indicated that co-infection with TB increases the risk of HIV progression and death. Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of these dual epidemics, with about 2.4 million HIV-infected people living with TB. The main objective of our study was to assess whether the pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and percentages could serve as biomarkers for post-HAART treatment immune-recovery in HIV-positive children with and without TB co-infection.
            
            
              Methods
              The data analyzed in this retrospective study were collected from a cohort of 305 HIV-infected children being treated with HAART. A Lehmann family of ROC curves were used to assess the diagnostic performance of pre- HAART treatment CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage as biomarkers for post-HAART immune recovery. The Kaplan–Meier estimator was used to compare differences in post-HAART recovery times between patients with and without TB co-infection.
            
            
              Results
              We found that the diagnostic performance of both pre-HARRT treatment CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage was comparable and achieved accuracies as high as 74\%. Furthermore, the predictive capability of pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage were slightly better in TB-negative patients. Our analyses also indicate that TB-negative patients have a shorter recovery time compared to the TB-positive patients.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage are stronger predictors of immune recovery in TB-negative pediatric patients, suggesting that TB co-infection complicates the treatment of HIV in this cohort. These findings suggest that the detection and treatment of TB is essential for the effectiveness of HAART in HIV-infected pediatric patients.},

	abstract = {It has been well demonstrated that adversarial examples, i.e., natural images with visually imperceptible perturbations added, generally exist for deep networks to fail on image classification. In this paper, we extend adversarial examples to semantic segmentation and object detection which are much more difficult. Our observation is that both segmentation and detection are based on classifying multiple targets on an image (e.g., the basic target is a pixel or a receptive field in segmentation, and an object proposal in detection), which inspires us to optimize a loss function over a set of pixels/proposals for generating adversarial perturbations. Based on this idea, we propose a novel algorithm named Dense Adversary Generation (DAG), which generates a large family of adversarial examples, and applies to a wide range of state-of-the-art deep networks for segmentation and detection. We also find that the adversarial perturbations can be transferred across networks with different training data, based on different architectures, and even for different recognition tasks. In particular, the transferability across networks with the same architecture is more significant than in other cases. Besides, summing up heterogeneous perturbations often leads to better transfer performance, which provides an effective method of black-box adversarial attack.},

These problems pose major obstacles for the adoption of neural networks in domains that require security or transparency. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of defenses that differentiably penalize the degree to which small changes in inputs can alter model predictions. Across multiple attacks, architectures, defenses, and datasets, we find that neural networks trained with this input gradient regularization exhibit robustness to transferred adversarial examples generated to fool all of the other models. We also find that adversarial examples generated to fool gradient-regularized models fool all other models equally well, and actually lead to more "legitimate," interpretable misclassifications as rated by people (which we confirm in a human subject experiment). Finally, we demonstrate that regularizing input gradients makes them more naturally interpretable as rationales for model predictions. We conclude by discussing this relationship between interpretability and robustness in deep neural networks.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) dramatically increases the risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). Several studies have indicated that co-infection with TB increases the risk of HIV progression and death. Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of these dual epidemics, with about 2.4 million HIV-infected people living with TB. The main objective of our study was to assess whether the pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and percentages could serve as biomarkers for post-HAART treatment immune-recovery in HIV-positive children with and without TB co-infection.
            Methods
            The data analyzed in this retrospective study were collected from a cohort of 305 HIV-infected children being treated with HAART. A Lehmann family of ROC curves were used to assess the diagnostic performance of pre- HAART treatment CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage as biomarkers for post-HAART immune recovery. The Kaplan–Meier estimator was used to compare differences in post-HAART recovery times between patients with and without TB co-infection.
            Results
            We found that the diagnostic performance of both pre-HARRT treatment CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage was comparable and achieved accuracies as high as 74\%. Furthermore, the predictive capability of pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage were slightly better in TB-negative patients. Our analyses also indicate that TB-negative patients have a shorter recovery time compared to the TB-positive patients.
            Conclusions
            Pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage are stronger predictors of immune recovery in TB-negative pediatric patients, suggesting that TB co-infection complicates the treatment of HIV in this cohort. These findings suggest that the detection and treatment of TB is essential for the effectiveness of HAART in HIV-infected pediatric patients.},

Manual delineation practices require anatomical knowledge, are expensive, time consuming and can be inaccurate due to human error. Here, we describe a semantic segmentation network for tumor subregion segmentation from 3D MRIs based on encoder-decoder architecture. Due to a limited training dataset size, a variational auto-encoder branch is added to reconstruct the input image itself in order to regularize the shared decoder and impose additional constraints on its layers. The current approach won 1st place in the BraTS 2018 challenge.},

	abstract = {Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with different degrees of aggressiveness, variable prognosis and various heterogeneous histologic sub-regions, i.e., peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue, necrotic core, active and non-enhancing core. This intrinsic heterogeneity is also portrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by varying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties. Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that make these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount of resected tumor is a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, when evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the various tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis towards prediction of patient overall survival. This study assesses the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used for brain tumor image analysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, i.e., 2012-2018. Specifically, we focus on i) evaluating segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions in pre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential tumor progression by virtue of longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANO criteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRI scans of patients that underwent gross total resection. Finally, we investigate the challenge of identifying the best ML algorithms for each of these tasks, considering that apart from being diverse on each instance of the challenge, the multi-institutional mpMRI BraTS dataset has also been a continuously evolving/growing dataset.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11799},
	abstract = {Decision forests (DFs), in particular random forests and gradient boosting trees, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other methods in many supervised learning scenarios. In particular, DFs dominate other methods in tabular data, that is, when the feature space is unstructured, so that the signal is invariant to permuting feature indices. However, in structured data lying on a manifold---such as images, text, and speech---deep networks (DNs), specifically convolutional deep networks (ConvNets), tend to outperform DFs. We conjecture that at least part of the reason for this is that the input to DNs is not simply the feature magnitudes, but also their indices (for example, the convolution operation uses feature locality). In contrast, naive DF implementations fail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed DF approach demonstrates that DFs, for each node, implicitly sample a random matrix from some specific distribution. These DFs, like some classes of DNs, learn by partitioning the feature space into convex polytopes corresponding to linear functions. We build on that approach and show that one can choose distributions in a manifold-aware fashion to incorporate feature locality. We demonstrate the empirical performance on data whose features live on three different manifolds: a torus, images, and time-series. In all simulations, our Manifold Oblique Random Forest (MORF) algorithm empirically dominates other state-of-the-art approaches that ignore feature space structure and challenges the performance of ConvNets. Moreover, MORF runs significantly faster than ConvNets and maintains interpretability and theoretical justification. This approach, therefore, has promise to enable DFs and other machine learning methods to close the gap to deep networks on manifold-valued data.},

	abstract = {Graph classification and regression have wide applications in a variety of domains. A graph is a complex and high-dimensional object, which poses great challenges to traditional machine learning algorithms. Accurately and efficiently locating a small signal subgraph dependent on the label of interest can dramatically improve the performance of subsequent statistical inference. Moreover, estimating a signal subgraph can aid humans with interpreting these results. We present a vertex screening method to identify the signal subgraph when given multiple graphs and associated labels. The method utilizes distance-based correlation to screen the vertices, and allows the subsequent classification and regression to be performed on a small induced subgraph. We demonstrate that this method is consistent in recovering signal vertices and leads to better classification performance via theory and numerical experiments. We apply the vertex screening algorithm on human and murine graphs derived from functional and structural magnetic resonance images to analyze the site effects and sex differences.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/188706},
	abstract = {Modern scientific discovery depends on collecting large heterogeneous datasets with many sources of variability, and applying domain-specific pipelines from which one can draw insight or clinical utility. For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, which add to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies and result in failures to replicate (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols). Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroData’s MRI to Graphs (NDMG) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducability, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran on 25 different studies (≈6,000 scans) from 19 sites, with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences varied across individuals and studies—much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We therefore provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.},

	abstract = {Distance correlation has gained much recent attention in the data science community: the sample statistic is straightforward to compute and asymptotically equals zero if and only if independence, making it an ideal choice to test any type of dependency structure given sufficient sample size. One major bottleneck is the testing process: because the null distribution of distance correlation depends on the underlying random variables and metric choice, it typically requires a permutation test to estimate the null and compute the p-value, which is very costly for large amount of data. To overcome the difficulty, we propose a centered chi-square distribution, demonstrate it well-approximates the limiting null distribution of unbiased distance correlation, and prove upper tail dominance and distribution bound. The resulting distance correlation chi-square test is a nonparametric test for independence, is valid and universally consistent using any strong negative type metric or characteristic kernel, enjoys a similar finite-sample testing power as the standard permutation test, is provably most powerful among all valid tests of distance correlation using known distributions, and is also applicable to K-sample and partial testing.},

Here, we provide an overview from the perspective of statistical network science of the kinds of models, assumptions, problems, and applications that are theoretically and empirically justified for analysis of connectome data.  We hope this review spurs further development and application of statistically grounded methods in connectomics.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01645},
	abstract = {Community structure in networks is observed in many different domains, and unsupervised community detection has received a lot of attention in the literature. Increasingly the focus of network analysis is shifting towards using network information in some other prediction or inference task rather than just analyzing the network itself. In particular, in neuroimaging applications brain networks are available for multiple subjects and the goal is often to predict a phenotype of interest. Community structure is well known to be a feature of brain networks, typically corresponding to different regions of the brain responsible for different functions. There are standard parcellations of the brain into such regions, usually obtained by applying clustering methods to brain connectomes of healthy subjects. However, when the goal is predicting a phenotype or distinguishing between different conditions, these static communities from an unrelated set of healthy subjects may not be the most useful for prediction. Here we present a method for supervised community detection, aiming to find a partition of the network into communities that is most useful for predicting a particular response. We use a block-structured regularization penalty combined with a prediction loss function, and compute the solution with a combination of a spectral method and an ADMM optimization algorithm. We show that the spectral clustering method recovers the correct communities under a weighted stochastic block model. The method performs well on both simulated and real brain networks, providing support for the idea of task-dependent brain regions.},

	title = {Inference for multiple heterogeneous networks with a common invariant subspace},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10026},
	abstract = {The development of models for multiple heterogeneous network data is of critical importance both in statistical network theory and across multiple application domains. Although single-graph inference is well-studied, multiple graph inference is largely unexplored, in part because of the challenges inherent in appropriately modeling graph differences and yet retaining sufficient model simplicity to render estimation feasible. This paper addresses exactly this gap, by introducing a new model, the common subspace independent-edge (COSIE) multiple random graph model, which describes a heterogeneous collection of networks with a shared latent structure on the vertices but potentially different connectivity patterns for each graph. The COSIE model encompasses many popular network representations, including the stochastic blockmodel. The model is both flexible enough to meaningfully account for important graph differences and tractable enough to allow for accurate inference in multiple networks. In particular, a joint spectral embedding of adjacency matrices - the multiple adjacency spectral embedding (MASE) - leads, in a COSIE model, to simultaneous consistent estimation of underlying parameters for each graph. Under mild additional assumptions, MASE estimates satisfy asymptotic normality and yield improvements for graph eigenvalue estimation and hypothesis testing. In both simulated and real data, the COSIE model and the MASE embedding can be deployed for a number of subsequent network inference tasks, including dimensionality reduction, classification, hypothesis testing and community detection. Specifically, when MASE is applied to a dataset of connectomes constructed through diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, the result is an accurate classification of brain scans by patient and a meaningful determination of heterogeneity across scans of different subjects.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relationships between different properties of data, such as whether a genome or connectome has information about disease status, is increasingly important. While existing approaches can test whether two properties are related, they may require unfeasibly large sample sizes and often are not interpretable. Our approach, ‘Multiscale Graph Correlation’ (MGC), is a dependence test that juxtaposes disparate data science techniques, including k-nearest neighbors, kernel methods, and multiscale analysis. Other methods may require double or triple the number of samples to achieve the same statistical power as MGC in a benchmark suite including high-dimensional and nonlinear relationships, with dimensionality ranging from 1 to 1000. Moreover, MGC uniquely characterizes the latent geometry underlying the relationship, while maintaining computational efficiency. In real data, including brain imaging and cancer genetics, MGC detects the presence of a dependency and provides guidance for the next experiments to conduct.
          , 
            If you want to estimate whether height is related to weight in humans, what would you do? You could measure the height and weight of a large number of people, and then run a statistical test. Such ‘independence tests’ can be thought of as a screening procedure: if the two properties (height and weight) are not related, then there is no point in proceeding with further analyses.
            In the last 100 years different independence tests have been developed. However, classical approaches often fail to accurately discern relationships in the large, complex datasets typical of modern biomedical research. For example, connectomics datasets include tens or hundreds of thousands of connections between neurons that collectively underlie how the brain performs certain tasks. Discovering and deciphering relationships from these data is currently the largest barrier to progress in these fields. Another drawback to currently used methods of independence testing is that they act as a ‘black box’, giving an answer without making it clear how it was calculated. This can make it difficult for researchers to reproduce their findings – a key part of confirming a scientific discovery. Vogelstein et al. therefore sought to develop a method of performing independence tests on large datasets that can easily be both applied and interpreted by practicing scientists.
            The method developed by Vogelstein et al., called Multiscale Graph Correlation (MGC, pronounced ‘magic’), combines recent developments in hypothesis testing, machine learning, and data science. The result is that MGC typically requires between one half to one third as big a sample size as previously proposed methods for analyzing large, complex datasets. Moreover, MGC also indicates the nature of the relationship between different properties; for example, whether it is a linear relationship or not.
            Testing MGC on real biological data, including a cancer dataset and a human brain imaging dataset, revealed that it is more effective at finding possible relationships than other commonly used independence methods. MGC was also the only method that explained how it found those relationships.
            MGC will enable relationships to be found in data across many fields of inquiry – and not only in biology. Scientists, policy analysts, data journalists, and corporate data scientists could all use MGC to learn about the relationships present in their data. To that extent, Vogelstein et al. have made the code open source in MATLAB, R, and Python.},

Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are the backbone of ART regimens. NRTIs compete with endogenous deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) in incorporation into elongating DNA chain resulting in their cytotoxic or antiviral effect. Thus, the efficacy of NRTIs could be affected by direct competition with endogenous dNTPs and/or feedback inhibition of their metabolic enzymes. In this paper, we assessed whether the levels of ribonucleotides (RN) and dNTP pool sizes can be used as biomarkers in distinguishing between HIV-infected patients with ART-induced mitochondrial toxicity and HIV-infected patients without toxicity.},

To study the relationships between different graph properties, we examine low-order non-isomorphic graphs and provide a simple visual analytics system to explore correlations across multiple graph properties. However, for larger graphs, studying the entire space quickly becomes intractable. We use different random graph generation methods to further look into the distribution of graph properties for higher order graphs and investigate the impact of various sampling methodologies. We also describe a method for generating many graphs that are identical over a number of graph properties and statistics yet are clearly different and identifiably distinct.},

            Using brain atlases to localize regions of interest is a required for making neuroscientifically valid statistical inferences. These atlases, represented in volumetric or surface coordinate spaces, can describe brain topology from a variety of perspectives. Although many human brain atlases have circulated the field over the past fifty years, limited effort has been devoted to their standardization and specification. The purpose of standardization and specification is to ensure consistency and transparency with respect to orientation, resolution, labeling scheme, file storage format, and coordinate space designation. Consequently, researchers are often confronted with limited knowledge about a given atlas’s organization, which make analytic comparisons more difficult. To fill this gap, we consolidate an extensive selection of popular human brain atlases into a single, curated open-source library, where they are stored following a standardized protocol with accompanying metadata. We propose that this protocol serves as the basis for storing future atlases. To demonstrate the utility of storing and standardizing these atlases following a common protocol, we conduct an experiment using data from the Healthy Brain Network whereby we quantify the statistical dependence of each atlas label on several key phenotypic variables. The repository containing the atlases, the specification, as well as relevant transformation functions is available at

ROC analysis can be used for diagnostic tests with outcomes measured on ordinal, interval or ratio scales. The dependence of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity on the selected cut-off value must be considered for a full test evaluation and for test comparison. All possible combinations of sensitivity and specificity that can be achieved by changing the test's cut-off value can be summarised using a single parameter; the area under the ROC curve. The ROC technique can also be used to optimise cut-off values with regard to a given prevalence in the target population and cost ratio of false-positive and false-negative results. However, plots of optimisation parameters against the selected cut-off value provide a more-direct method for cut-off selection. Candidates for such optimisation parameters are linear combinations of sensitivity and specificity (with weights selected to reflect the decision-making situation), odds ratio, chance-corrected measures of association (e. g. kappa) and likelihood ratios. We discuss some recent developments in ROC analysis, including meta-analysis of diagnostic tests, correlated ROC curves (paired-sample design) and chance- and prevalence-corrected ROC curves.},

The approach is based on explicit and quantitative environmental correlations between observed landslide occurrences, climate, parent material, and environmental attributes while the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used as a measure of performance of a predictive rule. The modeling results suggest that development of two independent models for road related and non-road related landslide hazard was necessary because spatial prediction and predictor variables were different for these models. The probabilistic models of landslide potential may be used as a decision support tool in forest planning involving the maintenance, obliteration or development of new forest roads in steep mountainous terrain.},

Only electron microscopy (EM) enables complete, unbiased mapping of synaptic connectivity; however, the fly brain is too large for conventional EM. We developed a custom high-throughput EM platform and imaged the entire brain of an adult female fly at synaptic resolution. To validate the dataset, we traced brain-spanning circuitry involving the mushroom body (MB), which has been extensively studied for its role in learning. All inputs to Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the MB, were mapped, revealing a previously unknown cell type, postsynaptic partners of KC dendrites, and unexpected clustering of olfactory projection neurons. These reconstructions show that this freely available EM volume supports mapping of brain-spanning circuits, which will significantly accelerate Drosophila neuroscience. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

Here we use advances in micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) technology to explore the brain of an important insect pollinator and model organism, the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris). Here we present a method for accurate imaging and exploration of insect brains that keeps brain tissue free from trauma and in its natural stereo-geometry, and showcase our 3D reconstructions and analyses of 19 individual brains at high resolution. Development of this protocol allows relatively rapid and cost effective brain reconstructions, making it an accessible methodology to the wider scientific community. The protocol describes the necessary steps for sample preparation, tissue staining, micro-CT scanning and 3D reconstruction, followed by a method for image analysis using the freeware SPIERS. These image analysis methods describe how to virtually extract key composite structures from the insect brain, and we demonstrate the application and precision of this method by calculating structural volumes and investigating the allometric relationships between bumblebee brain structures.},

This organization maximizes performance of a model output neuron on a stimulus discrimination task. We also report a novel canonical circuit in each mushroom body compartment with previously unidentified connections: reciprocal Kenyon cell to modulatory neuron connections, modulatory neuron to output neuron connections, and a surprisingly high number of recurrent connections between Kenyon cells. Stereotyped connections found between output neurons could enhance the selection of learned behaviours.

The clinical presentation, behavioural symptoms, imaging, and histopathology findings are strikingly heterogeneous. A more complete understanding of autism can be obtained by examining multiple genetic or behavioural mouse models of autism using MRI based neuroanatomical phenotyping. Twenty-six different mouse models were examined and the consistently found abnormal brain regions across models were the parieto-temporal lobe, cerebellar cortex, frontal lobe, hypothalamus, and the striatum. These models separated into three distinct clusters, two of which can be linked to the under and over-connectivity found in autism. These clusters also identified previously unknown connections between Nrxn1α, En2, and Fmr1; Nlgn3, BTBR, and Slc6A4; and also between X monosomy and Mecp2. With no single treatment for autism found, clustering autism using neuroanatomy and identifying these strong connections may prove to be a crucial step in predicting treatment response.},

	abstract = {The Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem is a prominent NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem of great importance in both theory and application. Local search has proved successful for this problem. However, there are two main drawbacks in state-of-the-art MVC local search algorithms. First, they select a pair of vertices to exchange simultaneously, which is timeconsuming. Secondly, although using edge weighting techniques to diversify the search, these algorithms lack mechanisms for decreasing the weights. To address these issues, we propose two new strategies: two-stage exchange and edge weighting with forgetting. The two-stage exchange strategy selects two vertices to exchange separately and performs the exchange in two stages. The strategy of edge weighting with forgetting not only increases weights of uncovered edges, but also decreases some weights for each edge periodically. These two strategies are used in designing a new MVC local search algorithm, which is referred to as NuMVC. We conduct extensive experimental studies on the standard benchmarks, namely DIMACS and BHOSLIB. The experiment comparing NuMVC with state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms show that NuMVC is at least competitive with the nearest competitor namely PLS on the DIMACS benchmark, and clearly dominates all competitors on the BHOSLIB benchmark. Also, experimental results indicate that NuMVC finds an optimal solution much faster than the current best exact algorithm for Maximum Clique on random instances as well as some structured ones. Moreover, we study the effectiveness of the two strategies and the run-time behaviour through experimental analysis.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A decrease in the mitochondrial (mt) DNA to nuclear DNA ratio has gained acceptance as a marker of mitochondrial toxicity in treated HIV-infected patients, but the functional meaning of this alteration is unclear.
METHODS: We assessed mtDNA content, mitochondrial content and function in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of consecutive asymptomatic HIV-infected patients. Patients selected had been receiving a first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen for at least 6 months, consisting of zidovudine plus lamivudine or stavudine plus didanosine plus either nelfinavir or nevirapine, or were antiretroviral-naive. The mtDNA content was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, mitochondrial content by citrate synthase activity, enzyme activity of complexes III and IV (both partially encoded by mtDNA) of the electron transport chain by spectrophotometry, oxygen consumption by polarography, and oxidative damage in cell membranes by monitoring cis-parinaric acid fluorescence.
RESULTS: Mitochondrial content was significantly lower in all treated groups. Patients receiving stavudine plus didanosine had mtDNA depletion and a decrease in complex IV activity. However, oxygen consumption capacity and lipid peroxidation were unaffected in all groups.
CONCLUSION: Long-term HAART may induce mitochondrial abnormalities in PBMC mitochondria, which do not necessarily translate into functional abnormalities, at least in asymptomatic patients.},

	abstract = {To gain a more detailed insight into the metabolism of 2', 2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (dFdC, gemcitabine, Gemzar) and its effect on normal ribonucleotide (NTP) metabolism in relation to sensitivity, we studied the accumulation of dFdCTP and the changes in NTP pools after dFdC exposure in a panel of 21 solid tumour and leukaemia cell lines. Both sensitivity to dFdC and accumulation of dFdCTP were clearly cell line-dependent: in this panel of cell lines, the head and neck cancer (HNSCC) cell line 22B appeared to be the most sensitive, whereas the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines were the least sensitive to dFdC. The human leukaemia cell line CCRF-CEM accumulated the highest concentration of dFdCTP, whereas the non-SCLC cell lines accumulated the least. Not only the amount of dFdCTP accumulation was clearly related to the sensitivity for dFdC (R=-0.61), but also the intrinsic CTP/UTP ratio (R=0.97). NTP pools were affected considerably by dFdC treatment: in seven cell lines dFdC resulted in a 1.7-fold depletion of CTP pools, in two cell lines CTP pools were unaffected, but in 12 cell lines CTP pools increased about 2-fold. Furthermore, a 1.6-1.9-fold rise in ATP, UTP and GTP pools was shown in 20, 19 and 20 out of 21 cell lines, respectively. Only the UTP levels after treatment with dFdC were clearly related to the amount of dFdCTP accumulating in the cell (R=0.64 (P{\textless}0.01)), but not to the sensitivity to dFdC treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrate that besides the accumulation of dFdCTP, the CTP/UTP ratio was clearly related to the sensitivity to dFdC. Furthermore, the UTP levels and the CTP/UTP ratio after treatment were related to dFdCTP accumulation. Therefore, both the CTP and UTP pools appear to play an important role in the sensitivity to dFdC.},

	abstract = {The in vitro cytotoxicity of gemcitabine (dFdC) was tested in ovarian and colon cancer cell lines grown as monolayers and three-dimensional multilayered cell cultures. In our model, dFdC showed slight selectivity in cytotoxicity against ovarian over colon cancer cells, when cell lines were grown as monolayers. However, when cell lines were grown as multilayers, this selectivity was accentuated: A2780 multilayers were 14 times less sensitive than monolayers, but the colon cancer cell lines were more than 1000 times more resistant than their corresponding monolayers. The accumulation of the active metabolite, dFdCTP, after 24 h exposure to 1 microM dFdC varied between 1100 and 1900 pmol/10(6) cells in monolayers. This was 5 times lower in multilayers compared with monolayers of all four cell lines, which can, in part, explain the lower sensitivity of the multilayers. In addition, it appears that the amount of the active metabolite retained is more important than the amount accumulated initially, since the differences between the ovarian and the colon cancer cell lines were more evident in retention experiments. Exposure to dFdC caused a 2-3-fold increase in the levels of several nucleotides, except for the CTP pools in the colon cancer lines, which were reduced by 3-fold at the highest dFdC concentration (10 microM). The findings with the multilayer model are in better agreement with in vivo activity in ovarian cancer and colon cancer than those with the monolayer system. This indicates the potential of the multilayer system to be a better predictive model than the conventionally used monolayer cultures.},

In addition, it is evident that the toxicity of antiviral nucleoside analogs is determined in part by the extent to which their intracellular conversion to dNTP analogs occurs within the mitochondrion. Finally, recent work from this laboratory has shown considerable variation among different mammalian tissues with respect to mitochondrial dNTP pool sizes and has suggested that natural asymmetries in mitochondrial dNTP concentrations may contribute to the high rates at which the mitochondrial genome undergoes mutation. These factors suggest that much more information is needed about maintenance and regulation of dNTP pools within mammalian mitochondria.

At the same time, aspects of deoxyribonucleotide metabolism have been shown to be critically involved in processes as diverse as cell cycle control, protooncogene expression, cellular defense against HIV infection, replication rate control, telomere length control, and mitochondrial function. Evidence supports a relationship between dNTP pools and microsatellite repeat instability. Relationships between dNTP synthesis and breakdown in controlling steady-state pools have become better defined. In addition, new experimental approaches have allowed definitive analysis of mutational pathways induced by dNTP pool abnormalities, both in Escherichia coli and in yeast. Finally, ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP) pools have been shown to be critical determinants of DNA replication fidelity. These developments are discussed in this review article.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with multiple mutations in mitochondrial DNA, both deletions and point mutations, and mutations in the nuclear gene for thymidine phosphorylase. Spinazzola et al. (Spinazzola, A., Marti, R., Nishino, I., Andreu, A., Naini, A., Tadesse, S., Pela, I., Zammarchi, E., Donati, M., Oliver, J., and Hirano, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 4128-4133) showed that MNGIE patients have elevated circulating thymidine levels and they hypothesized that this generates imbalanced mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools, which in turn are responsible for mitochondrial (mt) DNA mutagenesis. We tested this hypothesis by culturing HeLa cells in medium supplemented with 50 microM thymidine. After 8-month growth, mtDNA in the thymidine-treated culture, but not the control, showed multiple deletions, as detected both by Southern blotting and by long extension polymerase chain reaction. After 4-h growth in thymidine-supplemented medium, we found the mitochondrial dTTP and dGTP pools to expand significantly, the dCTP pool to drop significantly, and the dATP pool to drop slightly. In whole-cell extracts, dTTP and dGTP pools also expanded, but somewhat less than in mitochondria. The dCTP pool shrank by about 50\%, and the dATP pool was essentially unchanged. These results are discussed in terms of the recent report by Nishigaki et al. (Nishigaki, Y., Marti, R., Copeland, W. C., and Hirano, M. (2003) J. Clin. Invest. 111, 1913-1921) that most mitochondrial point mutations in MNGIE patients involve T --{\textgreater} C transitions in sequences containing two As to the 5' side of a T residue. Our finding of dTTP and dGTP elevations and dATP depletion in mitochondrial dNTP pools are consistent with a mutagenic mechanism involving T-G mispairing followed by a next-nucleotide effect involving T insertion opposite A.},

Because mitochondrial and nuclear deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools are physically distinct and because dNTP concentrations influence replication fidelity, we asked whether mitochondrial dNTP pools are asymmetric with respect to each other. We report here that the concentrations of the four dNTPs are not equal in mitochondria isolated from several tissues of both young and old rats. In particular, in most tissues examined, mitochondrial dGTP concentrations are high relative to the other dNTPs. Moreover, in the presence of the biased dNTP concentrations measured in heart and skeletal muscle, the fidelity of DNA synthesis in vitro by normally highly accurate mtDNA polymerase γ is reduced, with error frequencies increased by as much as 3-fold, due to increased formation of template T·dGTP mismatches that are inefficiently corrected by proofreading. These data, plus some published data on specific mitochondrial mutations seen in human diseases, are consistent with the hypothesis that normal intramitochondrial dNTP pool asymmetries may contribute to spontaneous mutagenesis in the mammalian mitochondrial genome.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the clinical manifestations of mitochondrial toxicity associated with the use of nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and outlines strategies to manage these sequelae.
BACKGROUND: NRTIs are the key components of the antiretroviral combinations used in the management of patients infected with HIV. The available NRTIs differ in their convenience of administration, frequency of dosing, resistance profiles, and side-effect profiles. NRTIs act as competitive inhibitors of the RNA/DNA polymerase reverse transcriptase of HIV and cause chain termination in the growing viral DNA chain. Many of the important and treatment-limiting side effects of NRTIs may be related to the effect of these agents on human DNA polymerases, in particular, mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Depletion of mitochondrial DNA during chronic NRTI therapy may lead to cellular respiratory dysfunction and generalized and tissue- and drug-specific toxicities, including myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and lactic acidosis. Recently, it has been proposed that the fat redistribution syndrome, or lipodystrophy, reported during chronic antiretroviral therapy is a manifestation of the differential impact of at least some NRTIs on peripheral and visceral adipocytes. Management of potential mitochondrial toxicity during NRTI therapy remains a challenge. A range of nutritional supplements, both as treatments and prophylaxes, have been proposed, and some have been investigated in vitro; no in vivo studies have yet been conducted.
METHODS: The information in this review was compiled using MEDLINE and AIDSLINE searches of the literature, including conference abstracts.
CONCLUSIONS: At present, interruption of NRTI therapy or substitution of the probable causative agent with alternative NRTIs that appear to be better tolerated represents the mainstay of management for mitochondrial toxicity and its clinical manifestations.},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title.

	doi = {10.1002/hep.23647},
	abstract = {Efavirenz (EFV) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) widely used in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection therapy. It has been associated with hepatotoxic effects and alterations in lipid and body fat composition. Given the importance of the liver in lipid regulation, we have evaluated the effects of clinically used concentrations of EFV on the mitochondria and lipid metabolism of human hepatic cells in vitro. Mitochondrial function was rapidly undermined by EFV to an extent that varied with the concentration employed; in particular, respiration and intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were reduced whereas reactive oxygen species (ROS) production increased. Results in isolated mitochondria suggest that the mechanism responsible for these actions was a specific inhibition of complex I of the respiratory chain. The reduction in energy production triggered a compensatory mechanism mediated by the enzyme adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the master switch of cellular bioenergetics. Fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance demonstrated a rapid intracellular increase of neutral lipids, usually in the form of droplets. This was prevented by the AMPK inhibitor compound C and by removal of fatty acids from the culture medium. These effects were not reproduced by Nevirapine, another NNRTI. EFV is clinically coadministered with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Evaluation of one of the most common combination, EFV/Lamivudine/Abacavir, revealed that the effects of EFV on ROS production were enhanced.
CONCLUSION: Clinical concentrations of EFV induce bioenergetic stress in hepatic cells by acutely inhibiting mitochondrial function. This new mechanism of mitochondrial interference leads to an accumulation of lipids in the cytoplasm that is mediated by activation of AMPK.},

	abstract = {HIV protease inhibitors (HIV PI) reduce morbidity and mortality of HIV infection but cause multiple untoward effects. Because certain HIV PI evoke production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and volume-sensitive Cl− current (ICl,swell) is activated by ROS, we tested whether HIV PI stimulate ICl,swell in ventricular myocytes. Ritonavir and lopinavir elicited outwardly-rectifying Cl− currents under isosmotic conditions that were abolished by the selective ICl,swell-blocker DCPIB. In contrast, amprenavir, nelfinavir, and raltegravir, an integrase inhibitor, did not modulate ICl,swell acutely. Ritonavir also reduced action potential duration, but amprenavir did not. ICl,swell activation was attributed to ROS because ebselen, an H2O2, scavenger, suppressed ritonavir- and lopinavir-induced ICl,swell. Major ROS sources in cardiomyocytes are sarcolemmal NADPH oxidase and mitochondria. The specific NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin failed to block ritonavir- or lopinavir-induced currents, although it blocks ICl,swell elicited by osmotic swelling or stretch. In contrast, rotenone, a mitochondrial e− transport inhibitor, suppressed both ritonavir- and lopinavir-induced ICl,swell. ROS production was measured in HL-1 cardiomyocytes with C-H2DCFDA-AM and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) with JC-1. Flow cytometry confirmed that ritonavir and lopinavir but not amprenavir, nelfinavir, or raltegravir augmented ROS production, and HIV PI-induced ROS production was suppressed by rotenone but not NADPH oxidase blockade. Moreover, ritonavir, but not amprenavir, depolarized ΔΨm. These data suggest ritonavir and lopinavir activated ICl,swell via mitochondrial ROS production that was independent of NADPH oxidase. ROS-dependent modulation of ICl,swell and other ion channels by HIV PI may contribute to some of their actions in heart and perhaps other tissues.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A decrease in the mitochondrial (mt) DNA to nuclear DNA ratio has gained acceptance as a marker of mitochondrial toxicity in treated HIV-infected patients, but the functional meaning of this alteration is unclear.
METHODS: We assessed mtDNA content, mitochondrial content and function in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of consecutive asymptomatic HIV-infected patients. Patients selected had been receiving a first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen for at least 6 months, consisting of zidovudine plus lamivudine or stavudine plus didanosine plus either nelfinavir or nevirapine, or were antiretroviral-naive. The mtDNA content was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, mitochondrial content by citrate synthase activity, enzyme activity of complexes III and IV (both partially encoded by mtDNA) of the electron transport chain by spectrophotometry, oxygen consumption by polarography, and oxidative damage in cell membranes by monitoring cis-parinaric acid fluorescence.
RESULTS: Mitochondrial content was significantly lower in all treated groups. Patients receiving stavudine plus didanosine had mtDNA depletion and a decrease in complex IV activity. However, oxygen consumption capacity and lipid peroxidation were unaffected in all groups.
CONCLUSION: Long-term HAART may induce mitochondrial abnormalities in PBMC mitochondria, which do not necessarily translate into functional abnormalities, at least in asymptomatic patients.},

METHODS: Patients who initiated first cART between January 2008 and October 2014 were included. Discontinuation was defined as stop of at least 1 drug of the regimen, regardless of the reason. All causes of discontinuation were evaluated and 3 main endpoints were considered: toxicity, intolerance, and simplification. Predictors of discontinuation were examined separately for all 3 endpoints. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for the outcome discontinuation of ≥ 1 drug regardless of the reason. Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with treatment discontinuation because of the 3 reasons considered.
RESULTS: A total of 4052 patients were included. Main reason for stopping at least 1 drug were simplification (29\%), intolerance (21\%), toxicity (19\%), other causes (18\%), failure (8\%), planned discontinuation (4\%), and nonadherence (2\%). In a multivariable Cox model, predictors of discontinuation for simplification were heterosexual transmission (P = 0.007), being immigrant (P = 0.017), higher nadir lymphocyte T CD4 cell (P = 0.011), and higher lymphocyte T CD8 cell count (P = 0.025); for discontinuation due to intolerance: the use of statins (P = 0.029), higher blood glucose levels (P = 0.050). About toxicity: higher blood glucose levels (P = 0.010) and the use of zidovudine/lamivudine as backbone (P = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: In the late cART era, the main reason for stopping the initial regimen is simplification. This scenario reflects the changes in recommendations aimed to enhance adherence and quality of life, and minimize drug toxicity.},

In 1988, the suggestion that the first antiretroviral drug, zidovudine, was the potential cause of muscle pathology in HIV-infected persons resulted in structural and biochemical patient studies demonstrating acquired mitochondrial dysfunction. Assessment of subsequent nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral drugs has indicated that mitochondria are a common target of NRTI toxicity in multiple tissues, leading to a wide variety of pathology ranging from lipodystrophy to neuropathy. Overwhelmingly, these complications have emerged during post-licensing human studies. Subsequent animal and in vitro studies have then elucidated the potential pathological mechanisms, suggesting that NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity arises principally from inhibition of the sole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma, leading to a reduction in mtDNA content (depletion). Millions of patients have been treated with mitochondrially toxic NRTIs and these drugs remain the backbone of antiretroviral rollout in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Here we describe the 25-year history of antiretroviral associated mitochondrial pathology and critically review the strength of evidence linking clinical, histopathological, and molecular data. We discuss recently described novel mechanisms of NRTI-associated mitochondrial damage and whether or not recently licensed NRTIs may be considered free from mitochondrial toxicity.},

BackgroundThe human brain presents a puzzling and challenging paradox: Despite a fixed anatomy, characterized by its connectivity, its functional repertoire is vast, enabling action, perception, and cognition. This contrasts with organs like the heart that have a dynamic anatomy but just one function. The resolution of this paradox may reside in the brain's network architecture, which organizes local interactions to cope with diverse environmental demands—ensuring adaptability, robustness, resilience to damage, efficient message passing, and diverse functionality from a fixed structure. This review asks how recent advances in understanding brain networks elucidate the brain’s many-to-one (degenerate) function-structure relationships. In other words, how does diverse function arise from an apparently static neuronal architecture? We conclude that the emergence of dynamic functional connectivity, from static structural connections, calls for formal (computational) approaches to neuronal information processing that may resolve the dialectic between structure and function.

Brain function or cognition can be described as the global integration of local (segregated) neuronal operations that underlies hierarchical message passing among cortical areas, and which is facilitated by hierarchical modular network architectures.
AdvancesMuch of our understanding of brain connectivity rests on the way that it is measured and modeled. We consider two complementary approaches: the first has its basis in graph theory that aims to describe the network topology of (undirected) connections of the sort measured by noninvasive brain imaging of anatomical connections and functional connectivity (correlations) between remote sites. This is compared with model-based definitions of context-sensitive (directed) effective connectivity that are grounded in the biophysics of neuronal interactions.Recent topological network analyses of brain circuits suggest that modular and hierarchical structural networks are particularly suited for the functional integration of local (functionally specialized) neuronal operations that underlie cognition. Measurements of spontaneous activity reveal functional connectivity patterns that are similar to structural connectivity, suggesting that structural networks constrain functional networks. However, task-related responses that require context-sensitive integration disclose a divergence between function and structure that appears to rest mainly on long-range connections. In contrast to methods that describe network topology phenomenologically, model-based theoretical and computational approaches focus on the mechanisms of neuronal interactions that accommodate the dynamic reconfiguration of effective connectivity.We highlight the consilience between hierarchical topologies (based on structural and functional connectivity) and the effective connectivity that would be required for hierarchical message passing of the sort suggested by computational neuroscience.
OutlookIn summary, neuronal interactions represent dynamics on a fixed structural connectivity that underlie cognition and behavior. Such divergence of function from structure is, perhaps, the most intriguing property of the brain and invites intensive future research. By studying the dynamics and self-organization of functional networks, we may gain insight into the true nature of the brain as the embodiment of the mind. The repertoire of functional networks rests upon the (hidden) structural architecture of connections that enables hierarchical functional integration. Understanding these networks will require theoretical models of neuronal processing that underlies cognition.
How rich functionality emerges from the invariant structural architecture of the brain remains a major mystery in neuroscience. Recent applications of network theory and theoretical neuroscience to large-scale brain networks have started to dissolve this mystery. Network analyses suggest that hierarchical modular brain networks are particularly suited to facilitate local (segregated) neuronal operations and the global integration of segregated functions. Although functional networks are constrained by structural connections, context-sensitive integration during cognition tasks necessarily entails a divergence between structural and functional networks. This degenerate (many-to-one) function-structure mapping is crucial for understanding the nature of brain networks. The emergence of dynamic functional networks from static structural connections calls for a formal (computational) approach to neuronal information processing that may resolve this dialectic between structure and function.},

We introduce a generalization of many existing decision tree methods called "Random Projection Forests" (RPF), which is any decision forest that uses (possibly data dependent and random) linear projections. Using this framework, we introduce a special case, called "Lumberjack", using very sparse random projections, that is, linear combinations of a small subset of features. Lumberjack obtains statistically significantly improved accuracy over Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, and other approaches on a standard benchmark suites for classification with varying dimension, sample size, and number of classes. To illustrate how, why, and when Lumberjack outperforms other methods, we conduct extensive simulated experiments, in vectors, images, and nonlinear manifolds. Lumberjack typically yields improved performance over existing decision trees ensembles, while mitigating computational efficiency and scalability, and maintaining interpretability. Lumberjack can easily be incorporated into other ensemble methods such as boosting to obtain potentially similar gains.},

	abstract = {Purpose To investigate the structural brain connectome in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in patients with PD without MCI. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committees, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to enrollment. The individual structural brain connectome of 170 patients with PD (54 with MCI, 116 without MCI) and 41 healthy control subjects was obtained by using deterministic diffusion-tensor tractography. A network-based statistic was used to assess structural connectivity differences among groups. Results Patients with PD and MCI had global network alterations when compared with both control subjects and patients with PD without MCI (range, P = .004 to P = .048). Relative to control subjects, patients with PD and MCI had a large basal ganglia and frontoparietal network with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right hemisphere and a subnetwork with increased mean diffusivity (MD) involving similar regions bilaterally (P {\textless} .01). When compared with patients with PD without MCI, those with PD and MCI had a network with decreased FA, including basal ganglia and frontotemporoparietal regions bilaterally (P {\textless} .05). Similar findings were obtained by adjusting for motor disability (P {\textless} .05, permutation-corrected P = .06). At P {\textless} .01, patients with PD and MCI did not show network alterations relative to patients with PD without MCI. Network FA and MD values were used to differentiate patients with PD and MCI from healthy control subjects and patients with PD without MCI with fair to good accuracy (cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [principal + secondary connected components] range, 0.75-0.85). Conclusion A disruption of structural connections between brain areas forming a network contributes to determine an altered information integration and organization and thus cognitive deficits in patients with PD. These results provide novel information concerning the structural substrates of MCI in patients with PD and may offer markers that can be used to differentiate between patients with PD and MCI and patients with PD without MCI. © RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

	abstract = {A growing number of studies approach the brain as a complex network, the so-called 'connectome'. Adopting this framework, we examine what types or extent of damage the brain can withstand-referred to as network 'robustness'-and conversely, which kind of distortions can be expected after brain lesions. To this end, we review computational lesion studies and empirical studies investigating network alterations in brain tumour, stroke and traumatic brain injury patients. Common to these three types of focal injury is that there is no unequivocal relationship between the anatomical lesion site and its topological characteristics within the brain network. Furthermore, large-scale network effects of these focal lesions are compared to those of a widely studied multifocal neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease, in which central parts of the connectome are preferentially affected. Results indicate that human brain networks are remarkably resilient to different types of lesions, compared to other types of complex networks such as random or scale-free networks. However, lesion effects have been found to depend critically on the topological position of the lesion. In particular, damage to network hub regions-and especially those connecting different subnetworks-was found to cause the largest disturbances in network organization. Regardless of lesion location, evidence from empirical and computational lesion studies shows that lesions cause significant alterations in global network topology. The direction of these changes though remains to be elucidated. Encouragingly, both empirical and modelling studies have indicated that after focal damage, the connectome carries the potential to recover at least to some extent, with normalization of graph metrics being related to improved behavioural and cognitive functioning. To conclude, we highlight possible clinical implications of these findings, point out several methodological limitations that pertain to the study of brain diseases adopting a network approach, and provide suggestions for future research.},

We examine the analogues, in graph inference, of several canonical tenets of classical Euclidean inference: in particular, we summarize a body of existing results on the consistency and asymptotic normality of the adjacency and Laplacian spectral embeddings, and the role these spectral embeddings can play in the construction of single- and multi-sample hypothesis tests for graph data. We investigate several real-world applications, including community detection and classification in large social networks and the determination of functional and biologically relevant network properties from an exploratory data analysis of the Drosophila connectome.

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects extensive regions of the central nervous system. In this work, we evaluated the structural connectome of patients with PD, as mapped by diffusion-weighted MRI tractography and a multi-shell, multi-tissue (MSMT) constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) method to increase the precision of tractography at tissue interfaces. The connectome was mapped with probabilistic MSMT-CSD in 21 patients with PD and in 21 age- and gender-matched controls. Mapping was also performed by deterministic single-shell, single tissue (SSST)-CSD tracking and probabilistic SSST-CSD tracking for comparison. A support vector machine was trained to predict diagnosis based on a linear combination of graph metrics. We showed that probabilistic MSMT-CSD could detect significantly reduced global strength, efficiency, clustering, and small-worldness, and increased global path length in patients with PD relative to healthy controls; by contrast, probabilistic SSST-CSD only detected the difference in global strength and small-worldness. In patients with PD, probabilistic MSMT-CSD also detected a significant reduction in local efficiency and detected clustering in the motor, frontal temporoparietal associative, limbic, basal ganglia, and thalamic areas. The network-based statistic identified a subnetwork of reduced connectivity by MSMT-CSD and probabilistic SSST-CSD in patients with PD, involving key components of the cortico–basal ganglia–thalamocortical network. Finally, probabilistic MSMT-CSD had superior diagnostic accuracy compared with conventional probabilistic SSST-CSD and deterministic SSST-CSD tracking. In conclusion, probabilistic MSMT-CSD detected a greater extent of connectome pathology in patients with PD, including those with cortico–basal ganglia–thalamocortical network disruptions. Connectome analysis based on probabilistic MSMT-CSD may be useful when evaluating the extent of white matter connectivity disruptions in PD.,

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the motor system. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated deficits in anisotropy as well as increased diffusivity in the sub-cortical structures, primarily in the substantia nigra in PD. However, the clinical spectrum of PD is not limited to motor symptoms; rather, it encompasses several nonmotor symptoms such as depression, psychosis, olfactory dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. These nonmotor symptoms underscore PD as a complex neurological disorder arising from dysfunction of several network components. Therefore, to decipher the underlying neuropathology, it is crucial to employ novel network-based methods that can elucidate associations between specific network changes. This study aimed at assessing the large-scale structural network changes in PD. Structural connectomes were computed by using probabilistic fiber tracking on diffusion MRI between 86 regions of interest. Graph theoretic analysis on the connectome was carried out at several levels of granularity: global, local (nodal), lobar, and edge wise. Our findings demonstrate lower network clustering capability, overall lower neural connectivity, and significantly reduced nodal influence of the hippocampus in PD. In addition, extensive patterns of reduced connectivity were observed within and between the temporal, parietal, and occipital areas. In summary, our findings corroborate widespread structural disconnectivity that can be potentially linked to the nonmotor symptoms in PD.},

To determine the incidence of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder and to assess their detection rates in the Canadian primary care setting.


METHOD
The descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in 7 primary care clinics in 3 Canadian provinces, Ontario, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia, from December 6, 2005, to May 5, 2006. Patients in clinic waiting rooms who consented to participate in the study were administered the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (N = 840). These patients' medical charts were then reviewed for evidence of previous diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder. Misdiagnosis was defined as cases for which a diagnosis was reached on the MINI but not in the patient's chart.


RESULTS
Of the 840 primary care patients assessed, 27.2\%, 11.4\%, 12.6\%, 31.2\%, and 16.5\% of patients met criteria for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder, respectively. Misdiagnosis rates reached 65.9\% for major depressive disorder, 92.7\% for bipolar disorder, 85.8\% for panic disorder, 71.0\% for generalized anxiety disorder, and 97.8\% for social anxiety disorder.


CONCLUSIONS
With high prevalence rates and poor detection, there is an obvious need to enhance diagnostic screening in the primary care setting.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical case reports have suggested that the behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorders may improve with fever. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of illness on behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorders. Understanding the role of fever, if any, may be informative regarding causative mechanisms of and treatment opportunities for autism.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 30 children (aged 2-18 years) with autism spectrum disorders during and after an episode of fever. Parent responses to the Aberrant Behavior Checklist were collected during fever (body temperature {\textgreater} or = 38.0 degrees C/100.4 degrees F), when fever had abated and the child was asymptomatic, and when the child had been fever-free for 7 days. Data were compared with those collected from parents of 30 age-, gender-, and language skills-matched afebrile children with autism spectrum disorders during similar time intervals.
RESULTS: Fewer aberrant behaviors were recorded for febrile patients on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist subscales of irritability, hyperactivity, stereotypy, and inappropriate speech compared with control subjects. Per expectation, lethargy scores were greater during fevers, and all improvements were transient. Data from patients with fever were stratified on variables related to illness severity. In the majority of these subgroup comparisons, the data suggested that effects from fever persisted in the less sick patients as well as in those with more severe illness.
CONCLUSIONS: We documented behavior change among children with autism spectrum disorders during fever. The data suggest that these changes might not be solely the byproduct of general effects of sickness on behavior; however, more research is needed to prove conclusively fever-specific effects and elucidate their underlying biological mechanisms (possibly involving immunologic and neurobiological pathways, intracellular signaling, and synaptic plasticity).},

These are severe conditions that lead to social isolation and require lifelong professional care. Improved diagnosis of ASD and SCHZ provides early access to medication and therapy, but the reality is that the mechanisms and the cellular pathology underlying these conditions are mostly unknown at this time. Although both ASD and SCHZ have strong inherited components, genetic risk seems to be distributed in hundreds of variants, each conferring low risk. The poor understanding of the genetics of ASD and SCHZ is a significant hurdle to developing effective treatments for these costly conditions. The recent implementation of next-generation sequencing technologies and the creation of large consortia have started to reveal the genetic bases of ASD and SCHZ. Alterations in gene expression regulation, synaptic architecture and activity and immunity seem to be the main cellular mechanisms contributing to both ASD and SCHZ, a surprising overlap given the distinct phenotypes and onset of these conditions. These diverse pathways seem to converge in aberrant synaptic plasticity and remodelling, which leads to altered connectivity between relevant brain regions. Continuous efforts to understand the genetic basis of ASD and SCHZ will soon lead to significant progress in the mechanistic understanding of these prominent psychiatric disorders and enable the development of disease-modifying therapies for these devastating conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Findings from family and twin studies suggest that genetic contributions to psychiatric disorders do not in all cases map to present diagnostic categories. We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia.
METHODS: We analysed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33,332 cases and 27,888 controls of European ancestory. To characterise allelic effects on each disorder, we applied a multinomial logistic regression procedure with model selection to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. We examined cross-disorder effects of genome-wide significant loci previously identified for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and used polygenic risk-score analysis to examine such effects from a broader set of common variants. We undertook pathway analyses to establish the biological associations underlying genetic overlap for the five disorders. We used enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to assess whether SNPs with cross-disorder association were enriched for regulatory SNPs in post-mortem brain-tissue samples.
FINDINGS: SNPs at four loci surpassed the cutoff for genome-wide significance (p{\textless}5×10(-8)) in the primary analysis: regions on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24, and SNPs within two L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, CACNA1C and CACNB2. Model selection analysis supported effects of these loci for several disorders. Loci previously associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia had variable diagnostic specificity. Polygenic risk scores showed cross-disorder associations, notably between adult-onset disorders. Pathway analysis supported a role for calcium channel signalling genes for all five disorders. Finally, SNPs with evidence of cross-disorder association were enriched for brain eQTL markers.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that specific SNPs are associated with a range of psychiatric disorders of childhood onset or adult onset. In particular, variation in calcium-channel activity genes seems to have pleiotropic effects on psychopathology. These results provide evidence relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry, and towards a nosology informed by disease cause.

Findings were confirmed in 52 nuclear families (132 members with clinical phenotypes, 119 with DTI, and 84 with rsfMRI).

Microstructural properties of white matter tracts connecting ipsilateral cortical regions and the corpus callosum were significantly heritable, ranging from total additive genetic heritability (h$^{\textrm{2}}$) = 0.69 (SE, 0.13;\textit{P} = .0000002) for radial diffusivity of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus to h$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 0.46 (SE, 0.15;\textit{P} = .0009) for fractional anisotropy of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Association with ADHD symptoms was found in several tracts, most strongly for the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (\textit{t} = −3.05;\textit{P} = .003). Heritable patterns of functional connectivity were detected within the default mode (h$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 0.36; SE, 0.16; cluster level significance,\textit{P} \&lt; .002), cognitive control (h$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 0.32; SE, 0.15;\textit{P} \&lt; .002), and ventral attention networks (h$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 0.36; SE, 0.16;\textit{P} \&lt; .002). In all cases, subregions within each network showed heritable functional connectivity with the rest of that network. More symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity (\textit{t} = −2.63;\textit{P} = .008) and inattention (\textit{t} = −2.34;\textit{P} = .02) were associated with decreased functional connectivity within the default mode network. Some cross-modal correlations were purely phenotypic, such as that between axial diffusivity of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and heritable aspects of the default mode network (phenotypic correlation, ρ$_{\textrm{p}}$ = −0.12;\textit{P} = .03). A genetic cross-modal correlation was seen between the ventral attention network and radial diffusivity of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (genetic correlation, ρ$_{\textrm{g}}$ = −0.45,\textit{P} = .02).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Analysis of data on multigenerational extended and nuclear families identified the features of structural and functional connectivity that are both significantly heritable and associated with ADHD.

            Complex brain networks are increasingly characterized at different scales, including global summary statistics, community connectivity, and individual edges. While research relating brain networks to demographic and behavioral measurements has yielded many insights into brain-phenotype relationships, common analytical approaches only consider network information at a single scale, thus failing to incorporate rich information present at other scales. Here, we designed, implemented, and deployed Multi-Scale Network Regression (MSNR), a penalized multivariate approach for modeling brain networks that explicitly respects both edge- and community-level information by assuming a low rank and sparse structure, both encouraging less complex and more interpretable modeling. Capitalizing on a large neuroimaging cohort (
            n
            = 1, 051), we demonstrate that MSNR recapitulates interpretable and statistically significant association between functional connectivity patterns with brain development, sex differences, and motion-related artifacts. Notably, compared to single-scale methods, MSNR achieves a balance between prediction performance and model complexity, with improved interpretability. Together, by jointly exploiting both edge- and community-level information, MSNR has the potential to yield novel insights into brain-behavior relationships.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in resting-state neuroimaging demonstrates that the brain exhibits highly individualized patterns of functional connectivity—a “connectotype.” How these individualized patterns may be constrained by environment and genetics is unknown. Here we ask whether the connectotype is familial and heritable. Using a novel approach to estimate familiality via a machine-learning framework, we analyzed resting-state fMRI scans from two well-characterized samples of child and adult siblings. First we show that individual connectotypes were reliably identified even several years after the initial scanning timepoint. Familial relationships between participants, such as siblings versus those who are unrelated, were also accurately characterized. The connectotype demonstrated substantial heritability driven by high-order systems including the fronto-parietal, dorsal attention, ventral attention, cingulo-opercular, and default systems. This work suggests that shared genetics and environment contribute toward producing complex, individualized patterns of distributed brain activity, rather than constraining local aspects of function. These insights offer new strategies for characterizing individual aberrations in brain function and evaluating heritability of brain networks.},

	abstract = {The role of antibody in protection against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has been difficult to study in animal models because most primary HIV-1 strains do not infect nonhuman primates. Using a chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) based on the envelope of a primary isolate (HIV-89.6), we performed passive-transfer experiments in rhesus macaques to study the role of anti-envelope antibodies in protection. Based on prior in vitro data showing neutralization synergy by antibody combinations, we evaluated HIV immune globulin (HIVIG), and human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 2F5 and 2G12 given alone, compared with the double combination 2F5/2G12 and the triple combination HIVIG/2F5/2G12. Antibodies were administered 24 h prior to intravenous challenge with the pathogenic SHIV-89.6PD. Six control monkeys displayed high plasma viremia, rapid CD4(+)-cell decline, and clinical AIDS within 14 weeks. Of six animals given HIVIG/2F5/2G12, three were completely protected; the remaining three animals became SHIV infected but displayed reduced plasma viremia and near normal CD4(+)-cell counts. One of three monkeys given 2F5/2G12 exhibited only transient evidence of infection; the other two had marked reductions in viral load. All monkeys that received HIVIG, 2F5, or 2G12 alone became infected and developed high-level plasma viremia. However, compared to controls, monkeys that received HIVIG or MAb 2G12 displayed a less profound drop in CD4(+) T cells and a more benign clinical course. These data indicate a general correlation between in vitro neutralization and protection and suggest that a vaccine that elicits neutralizing antibody should have a protective effect against HIV-1 infection or disease.},

            Complex brain networks are increasingly characterized at different scales, including global summary statistics, community connectivity, and individual edges. While research relating brain networks to demographic and behavioral measurements has yielded many insights into brain-phenotype relationships, common analytical approaches only consider network information at a single scale, thus failing to incorporate rich information present at other scales. Here, we designed, implemented, and deployed Multi-Scale Network Regression (MSNR), a penalized multivariate approach for modeling brain networks that explicitly respects both edge- and community-level information by assuming a low rank and sparse structure, both encouraging less complex and more interpretable modeling. Capitalizing on a large neuroimaging cohort (
            n
            = 1, 051), we demonstrate that MSNR recapitulates interpretable and statistically significant association between functional connectivity patterns with brain development, sex differences, and motion-related artifacts. Notably, compared to single-scale methods, MSNR achieves a balance between prediction performance and model complexity, with improved interpretability. Together, by jointly exploiting both edge- and community-level information, MSNR has the potential to yield novel insights into brain-behavior relationships.},

            Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a devastating infection of the central nervous system lacking an adequate point-of-care diagnostic test. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 550 Zambian adults with suspected TBM to determine the diagnostic accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Xpert MTB/RIF, CSF lipoarabinomannan (LAM), urine LAM, CSF total protein, and CSF glucose compared with the gold standard of CSF culture. We categorized patients with a positive CSF tuberculosis (TB) culture as definite TBM. We also assessed inpatient and 1-year mortality on definite TBM patients when CSF Xpert MTB/RIF results were available in real time to treating physicians relative to a historical comparison cohort in whom Xpert results were not available in real time. Of the 550 patients, 474 (86.2\%) were HIV-infected and 105/550 (19.1\%) had definite TBM based on a positive CSF culture. The sensitivity/specificity of the diagnostic tests were CSF Xpert MTB/RIF, 52.9\%/94.2\%; CSF LAM, 21.9\%/94.2\%; urine LAM, 24.1\%/76.1\%; and CSF glucose {\textless}40 mg/dl, and total protein, {\textgreater}100 mg/dl, 66.3\%/90\%. A model including CSF Xpert MTB/RIF, CSF LAM, CSF glucose, and CSF total protein demonstrated an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.90. The inpatient and 1-year mortality for definite TBM was 43\% and 57\%, respectively. There was low sensitivity for the diagnosis of TBM across all diagnostics tests. CSF Xpert MTB/RIF and CSF LAM are highly specific for the diagnosis of TBM. Despite the use of Xpert MTB/RIF for diagnostic purpose in real time, TBM was still associated with a high mortality in Zambian patients.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
          MRI provides an opportunity to link neuroanatomic phenotypes to genetic expression. Genome-wide associative studies in the ENIGMA consortium and the UK Biobank have demonstrated significant links between brain structure and specific genes. Similar studies in rodents are challenging because of the scale. We report whole brain diffusion connectomes of four strains of mice (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, CAST/EiJ, and BTBR) at spatial resolution 20,000 times higher than the human connectome. We derived volumes and scalar diffusion metrics for 322 regions of the brain. Volume was the most heritable trait followed by FA, RD, and AD. These traits were heritable in {\textgreater} 60\% of the regions when comparing all four strains. Many were also highly heritable when the BTBR was not included. Using a unique statistical approach to limit false discovery allowed us to identify a number of specific brain nodes in which connectivity was highly heritable.
          
            HIGHLIGHTS
            
              
                
                  Microscopic MRI/DTI connectomes were generated in 4 strains of mice (n=8/strain).
                
                
                  Heritability of volume, and diffusion metrics was measured for 166 regions.
                
                
                  Low dimensional scaling allowed robust comparison of connectome nodes.
                
                
                  Volume, FA, AD, RD and connectome nodes are heritable in over 50\% of the regions.},

	abstract = {DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comprises a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive behaviors or restricted interests, and may both affect and be affected by multiple cognitive mechanisms. This study attempts to identify and characterize cognitive subtypes within the ASD population using our Functional Random Forest (FRF) machine learning classification model. This model trained a traditional random forest model on measures from seven tasks that reflect multiple levels of information processing. 47 ASD diagnosed and 58 typically developing (TD) children between the ages of 9 and 13 participated in this study. Our RF model was 72.7\% accurate, with 80.7\% specificity and 63.1\% sensitivity. Using the random forest model, the FRF then measures the proximity of each subject to every other subject, generating a distance matrix between participants. This matrix is then used in a community detection algorithm to identify subgroups within the ASD and TD groups, and revealed 3 ASD and 4 TD putative subgroups with unique behavioral profiles. We then examined differences in functional brain systems between diagnostic groups and putative subgroups using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rsfcMRI). Chi-square tests revealed a significantly greater number of between group differences (p {\textless} .05) within the cingulo-opercular, visual, and default systems as well as differences in inter-system connections in the somato-motor, dorsal attention, and subcortical systems. Many of these differences were primarily driven by specific subgroups suggesting that our method could potentially parse the variation in brain mechanisms affected by ASD.},

Here, we propose to combine the beneﬁts of both Bayesian optimization and banditbased methods, in order to achieve the best of both worlds: strong anytime performance and fast convergence to optimal conﬁgurations. We propose a new practical state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization method, which consistently outperforms both Bayesian optimization and Hyperband on a wide range of problem types, including high-dimensional toy functions, support vector machines, feed-forward neural networks, Bayesian neural networks, deep reinforcement learning, and convolutional neural networks.

The purpose of the current paper is to develop a bootstrap method for solving this problem in the context of regression --- which complements our companion paper in the context of classification (Lopes 2019). In contrast to the classification setting, the current paper shows that theoretical guarantees for the proposed bootstrap can be established under much weaker assumptions. In addition, we illustrate the flexibility of the method by showing how it can be adapted to measure algorithmic convergence for variable selection.

	doi = {10.1109/STSIVA.2016.7743357},
	abstract = {The epilepsy is a common neurological disease caused by a neuronal electric activity imbalance in any side of the brain, named epileptic focus. The epilepsy is characterized by recurrent and sudden seizures. Recently, researchers found that approximately 50\% of epileptic patients feel auras (subjective phenomenon which precedes and indicates an epileptic seizure onset) associated to a physiological anomaly. In this research, a non-invasive seizure prediction methodology is developed in order to improve the quality of life of the patients with epilepsy, alerting them about potential seizure and avoiding falls, injuries, wounds or even death. The research addresses the recognition of patterns in electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals taken from 7 patients with focal epilepsy whom are treated at the Instituto de Epilepsia y Parkinson del Eje Cafetero-NEUROCENTRO-. The biosignals were independently analyzed, at least 15 minutes before the seizure onset and in periods with no seizure were considered. The methodology considers the generation of features computed over the discrete wavelet transform of the EEG signal and others related to the heart rate variability in the ECG signal. Using feature selection techniques such as Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) with classification algorithms as cost functions (linear-Bayes and k-nearest neighbors classifier), we found which features have the most relevant information about pre-ictal state and which of them are the most appropriated for seizure forecasting, therefore we found that ECG signal could be a potential resource for predicting epileptic seizures, and we concluded that there are patterns in EEG and ECG signals that, via machine learning algorithms, can predict the epileptic seizure onset.},

It is shown here that random forests provide information about the full conditional distribution of the response variable, not only about the conditional mean. Conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests, a generalisation of random forests. Quantile regression forests give a non-parametric and accurate way of estimating conditional quantiles for high-dimensional predictor variables. The algorithm is shown to be consistent.

We introduce a generalization of many existing decision tree methods called "Random Projection Forests" (RPF), which is any decision forest that uses (possibly data dependent and random) linear projections. Using this framework, we introduce a special case, called "Lumberjack", using very sparse random projections, that is, linear combinations of a small subset of features. Lumberjack obtains statistically significantly improved accuracy over Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, and other approaches on a standard benchmark suites for classification with varying dimension, sample size, and number of classes. To illustrate how, why, and when Lumberjack outperforms other methods, we conduct extensive simulated experiments, in vectors, images, and nonlinear manifolds. Lumberjack typically yields improved performance over existing decision trees ensembles, while mitigating computational efficiency and scalability, and maintaining interpretability. Lumberjack can easily be incorporated into other ensemble methods such as boosting to obtain potentially similar gains.},

	abstract = {Geodesic distance is the shortest path between two points in a Riemannian manifold. Manifold learning algorithms, such as Isomap, seek to learn a manifold that preserves geodesic distances. However, such methods operate on the ambient dimensionality, and are therefore fragile to noise dimensions. We developed an unsupervised random forest method (URerF) to approximately learn geodesic distances in linear and nonlinear manifolds with noise. URerF operates on low-dimensional sparse linear combinations of features, rather than the full observed dimensionality. To choose the optimal split in a computationally efficient fashion, we developed a fast Bayesian Information Criterion statistic for Gaussian mixture models. We introduce geodesic precision-recall curves which quantify performance relative to the true latent manifold. Empirical results on simulated and real data demonstrate that URerF is robust to high-dimensional noise, where as other methods, such as Isomap, UMAP, and FLANN, quickly deteriorate in such settings. In particular, URerF is able to estimate geodesic distances on a real connectome dataset better than other approaches.},

We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment.

	title = {Inference for multiple heterogeneous networks with a common invariant subspace},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10026},
	abstract = {The development of models for multiple heterogeneous network data is of critical importance both in statistical network theory and across multiple application domains. Although single-graph inference is well-studied, multiple graph inference is largely unexplored, in part because of the challenges inherent in appropriately modeling graph differences and yet retaining sufficient model simplicity to render estimation feasible. This paper addresses exactly this gap, by introducing a new model, the common subspace independent-edge (COSIE) multiple random graph model, which describes a heterogeneous collection of networks with a shared latent structure on the vertices but potentially different connectivity patterns for each graph. The COSIE model encompasses many popular network representations, including the stochastic blockmodel. The model is both flexible enough to meaningfully account for important graph differences and tractable enough to allow for accurate inference in multiple networks. In particular, a joint spectral embedding of adjacency matrices - the multiple adjacency spectral embedding (MASE) - leads, in a COSIE model, to simultaneous consistent estimation of underlying parameters for each graph. Under mild additional assumptions, MASE estimates satisfy asymptotic normality and yield improvements for graph eigenvalue estimation. In both simulated and real data, the COSIE model and the MASE embedding can be deployed for a number of subsequent network inference tasks, including dimensionality reduction, classification, hypothesis testing and community detection. Specifically, when MASE is applied to a dataset of connectomes constructed through diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, the result is an accurate classification of brain scans by patient and a meaningful determination of heterogeneity across scans of different subjects.},

We report whole brain diffusion connectomes of four strains of mice (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, CAST/EiJ, and BTBR)at spatial resolution 20,000 times higher than the human connectome. We derived volumes and scalardiffusionmetricsfor 322 regions of the brain.Volume was the most heritable traitfollowed by FA,RD, and AD. These traits wereheritable in \&gt; 60\% of the regions when comparing all four strains. Manywere also highly heritable when the BTBR was not included. Using auniquestatisticalapproach to limit false discoveryallowed us to identify a number of specific brain nodesin which connectivity was highly heritable.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

ABIDE II includes datasets from an additional 487 individuals with ASD and 557 controls previously collected across 16 international institutions. The combination of ABIDE I and ABIDE II provides investigators with 2156 unique cross-sectional datasets allowing selection of samples for discovery and/or replication. This sample size can also facilitate the identification of neurobiological subgroups, as well as preliminary examinations of sex differences in ASD. Additionally, ABIDE II includes a range of psychiatric variables to inform our understanding of the neural correlates of co-occurring psychopathology; 284 diffusion imaging datasets are also included.

The author lists a number of justifications that have been offered for this choice, ranging from theoretical considerations of probability laws and signal detection theory, to mathematical tractability and convenience, to empirical results showing that "it fits!" To these justifications is added another, namely that even if an alternative formulation based on another underlying form (e.g., power law) or model (e.g., binomial, Poisson, or gamma type distributions) were in fact correct, the binormal fit differs so little from the true form as to be of no practical consequence. Moreover, the small lack of fit is unlikely to be demonstrated in practice: it is obscured by the much larger variation that can be attributed to sampling of cases. In addition, even if a very large sample of cases could be studied, the small number of rating categories used does not permit seemingly very different models to be distinguished from one another.

It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject. Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.},

	abstract = {We seek to (i) characterize the learning architectures exploited in biological neural networks for training on very few samples, and (ii) port these algorithmic structures to a machine learning context. The Moth Olfactory Network is among the simplest biological neural systems that can learn, and its architecture includes key structural elements and mechanisms widespread in biological neural nets, such as cascaded networks, competitive inhibition, high intrinsic noise, sparsity, reward mechanisms, and Hebbian plasticity. These structural biological elements, in combination, enable rapid learning. MothNet is a computational model of the Moth Olfactory Network, closely aligned with the moth's known biophysics and with in vivo electrode data collected from moths learning new odors. We assign this model the task of learning to read the MNIST digits. We show that MothNet successfully learns to read given very few training samples (1 to 10 samples per class). In this few-samples regime, it outperforms standard machine learning methods such as nearest-neighbors, support-vector machines, and neural networks (NNs), and matches specialized one-shot transfer-learning methods but without the need for pre-training. The MothNet architecture illustrates how algorithmic structures derived from biological brains can be used to build alternative NNs that may avoid some of the learning rate limitations of current engineered NNs.},

While histories of the "other" Americas often link disparate histories through revolutionary or tragic narratives, Latin America since Independence begins with the assumption that our efforts to imagine a common past for nearly thirty countries are deeply problematic. Without losing sight of chronology or regional trends, this text offers glimpses of the Latin American past through carefully selected stories. Each chapter introduces students to a specific historical issue, which in turn raises questions about the history of the Americas as a whole. Key themes include: Race and Citizenship Inequality and Economic Development Politics and Rights Social and Cultural Movements Globalization Violence and Civil Society The short, thematic chapters are bolstered by the inclusion of relevant primary documents - many translated for the first time - including advertisements and posters, song lyrics, political speeches, government documents, and more. Each chapter also includes timelines highlighting important dates and suggestions for further reading. Richly informative and highly readable, Latin America since Independence provides compelling accounts of this region's past and present. This second edition brings the story up to the present, with revised chapters, new primary documents and images, and a new 'At A Glance' feature that uses a selection of maps and tables to illuminate key issues like the economy, the environment, and demographics.

	abstract = {Classifying samples into categories becomes intractable when a single sample can have millions to billions of features, such as in genetics or imaging data. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is widely used to identify a low-dimensional representation of such features for further analysis. However, PCA, as well as most manifold learning techniques, operates on the means and variances of the data, ignoring class labels, such as whether or not a subject has cancer, thereby discarding information that could substantially improve downstream classification performance. We describe an approach, Linear Optimal Low-rank projection (LOL), which extends PCA by operating on the means and variances of each class of data, rather than pooling all classes together. We prove, and substantiate with synthetic and real data experiments, that LOL leads to a better representation of the data for subsequent classification than other linear approaches, while adding negligible computational cost. The simplicity of LOL enables its flexibility, leading to the development of several variants that improve its accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Using a novel dataset of magnetic resonance imaging scans consisting of 500 million features and 400 gigabytes of data, we demonstrate that LOL achieves better accuracy than other methods for any dimensionality, while only requiring a few minutes on a standard desktop computer.},

The inherent multi-modality of connectome datasets poses new challenges for data organization, integration and sharing. We have designed and implemented the Connectome Viewer Toolkit --- a set of free and extensible open-source neuroimaging tools written in Python. The key components of the toolkit are as follows: 1. The Connectome File Format is an XML-based container format to standardize multi-modal data integration and structured metadata annotation. 2. The Connectome File Format Library enables management and sharing of connectome files. 3. The Connectome Viewer is an integrated research and development environment for visualization and analysis of multi-modal connectome data. The Connectome Viewer's plugin architecture supports extensions with network analysis packages and an interactive scripting shell, to enable easy development and community contributions. Integration with tools from the scientific Python community allows the leveraging of numerous existing libraries for powerful connectome data mining, exploration and comparison. We demonstrate the applicability of the Connectome Viewer Toolkit using Diffusion MRI datasets processed by the Connectome Mapper. The Connectome Viewer Toolkit is available from http://www.cmtk.org/.},

	abstract = {We derive the asymptotic distribution of the maximum partial likelihood estimator β for the vector of regression coefficients β under a possibly misspecified Cox proportional hazards model. As in the parametric setting, this estimator β converges to a well-defined constant vector β*. In addition, the random vector n 1/2(β – β*) is asymptotically normal with mean 0 and with a covariance matrix that can be consistently estimated. The newly proposed robust covariance matrix estimator is similar to the so-called “sandwich” variance estimators that have been extensively studied for parametric cases. For many misspecified Cox models, the asymptotic limit β* or part of it can be interpreted meaningfully. In those circumstances, valid statistical inferences about the corresponding covariate effects can be drawn based on the aforementioned asymptotic theory of β and the related results for the score statistics. Extensive studies demonstrate that the proposed robust tests and interval estimation procedures are appropriate for practical use. In particular, the robust score tests perform quite well even for small samples. In contrast, the conventional model-based inference procedures often lead to tests with supranominal size and confidence intervals with rather poor coverage probability.},

Unfortunately, however, the time complexity of DeLong's algorithm is of quadratic order (the product of sample sizes), thus making it time-consuming and impractical when the sample sizes are large. Based on an equivalent relationship between the Heaviside function and mid-ranks of samples, we improve DeLong's algorithm by reducing the order of time complexity from quadratic down to linearithmic (the product of sample size and its logarithm). Monte Carlo simulations verify the computational efficiency of our algorithmic findings in this work.},

These curves are also appropriate for summarizing the performance of a discriminant analysis but are under-utilized by statisticians. This article is illustrates the use of these curves for comparing competing diagnostic systems, develops new estimation methods based on kernel density estimation, and studies the statistical performance of the new method. A transform of the ROC curve is further suggested based on the idea of "local population separation." This graphic is quite generally useful for displaying the differences between two populations. The methods are applied to a dataset comprising the results of seven diagnostics for predicting cancer activity on 353 patients. The distributions of these diagnostics are not well modeled parametrically, and so either completely nonparametric or kernel density estimation seems appropriate. Construction of the ROC curves shows not only if, but also how the diagnostics differ. The use of bootstrap simulation to check and adjust for the bias of smoothing is also demonstrated using these data.]},

The HIVdb genotypic resistance interpretation system output consists of (1) a list of penalty scores for each antiretroviral (ARV) resistance mutation in a submitted sequence, (2) estimates of decreased NRTI, NNRTI, protease and integrase inhibitor susceptibility, and (3) comments about each ARV resistance mutation in the submitted sequence. The application’s strengths are its convenience for submitting sequences, its quality control analysis, its transparency and its extensive comments. The Sierra Web service is an extension that enables laboratories analyzing many sequences to individualize the format of their results. The algorithm specification interface compiler makes it possible for HIVdb to provide results using a variety of different HIV-1 genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms.},

The most popular parametric model for an ROC curve is the binormal model, which assumes that the marker, after a monotone transformation, is normally distributed conditional on the outcome. Here we present an alternative to the binormal model based on the Lehmann family, also known as the proportional hazards specification. The resulting ROC curve and its functionals (such as the area under the curve and the sensitivity at a given level of specificity) have simple analytic forms. Closed-form expressions for the functional estimates and their corresponding asymptotic variances are derived. This family accommodates the comparison of multiple markers, covariate adjustments and clustered data through a regression formulation. Evaluation of the underlying assumptions, model fitting and model selection can be performed using any off the shelf proportional hazards statistical software package.},

Although the use of HAART remains limited in Africa, there are global efforts to make available these drugs to several million HIV-infected persons on the continent. In this review we examine the impact of HIV genetic diversity on the occurrence of drug-resistance mutations among non-B subtypes, and discuss the implication of resistant strains in programs aimed at implementing antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Africa, with respect to factors that may favor the occurrence of treatment-acquired drug-resistant viruses, ways to monitor for drug resistance, and strategies to limit its occurrence. We assert that antiretroviral drug resistance is an inevitable consequence when providing long-term treatment, and should not be seen as a limitation of providing antiretrovirals to patients in resource-poor settings, but rather a necessary challenge to be incorporated into the rational design of programs that provide ART in Africa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Africa. The interaction between TB and HIV infections is reviewed.
METHODS: Literature on TB, HIV and their co-infection, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, is reviewed.
RESULTS: Burden of TB is fueled by the HIV epidemic, and clinical presentation of TB may be atypical with co-infection. Recommendations on drugs and timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation are discussed. Use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (CPT) in co-infected patients reduces morbidity and mortality, while the principles of TB prevention in HIV infection can be summarized with the three I's: intensive TB case finding and surveillance, isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) and infection-control measures; to these can be added a fourth 'I,' viz., instituting ART. Clinical complications like drug resistance, toxicity and drug interactions; and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with CPT, IPT and ART are highlighted. Emergence of drug-resistant- and nosocomial- TB in HIV infection poses serious challenges and potential consequences in Africa, and appropriate measures are recommended.
CONCLUSIONS: Many barriers exist for optimizing the care of the two diseases, but the aim should be strengthening capacities, collaborations, linkages and eventually integrating the services. Interventions for TB prevention in HIV infection should be widely implemented.},

              . CD4+ T-lymphocyte monitoring is not routinely available in most resource-limited settings. We investigated predictors of time to CD4+ T-lymphocyte recovery in HIV-infected children on highly active antiretroviral (HAART) at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana.
              Methods
              . Time to CD4+ T-lymphocyte recovery was defined as achieving percent CD4+ T-lymphocytes of 25\%. We used Cox proportional hazard models for identifying significant predictor variables.
              Results
              . Of the 233 children with complete CD4+ T-lymphocyte data, the mean age at HAART initiation was 5.5 (
              
                SD

                3.1
              
              ) years. The median recovery time was 60 weeks (95\% CL: 55–65). Evidence at baseline of severe suppression in CD4+ T-lymphocyte count adjusted for age, age at HAART initiation, gender, and having parents alive were statistically significant in predicting time to CD4+ T-lymphocyte recovery.
              Conclusions
              . A targeted approach based on predictors of CD4+ T-lymphocyte recovery can be a viable and cost-effective way of monitoring HAART in HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings.},

While it is often sufficient to explore only the summary statistics of a dataset (e.g., min/mean/max), Anscombe's Quartet demonstrates how such statistics can be misleading. We consider a similar problem in the context of graph mining. To study the relationships between different graph properties, we examine low-order non-isomorphic graphs and provide a simple visual analytics system to explore correlations across multiple graph properties. However, for larger graphs, studying the entire space quickly becomes intractable. We use different random graph generation methods to further look into the distribution of graph properties for higher order graphs and investigate the impact of various sampling methodologies. We also describe a method for generating many graphs that are identical over a number of graph properties and statistics yet are clearly different and identifiably distinct.},

	abstract = {AIM: To compare the manifestations of chest tuberculosis (TB) in pediatric and adult patients based on contrast enhanced computed tomography of chest.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study consisting of 152 patients of chest TB including 48 children and 104 adults who had undergone contrast enhanced computed tomography of chest prior to treatment. The patterns and severity of parenchymal, mediastinal and pleural manifestations were analyzed and compared among different age groups.
RESULTS: Parenchymal changes observed include consolidation, air space nodules, miliary TB, cavitation, bronchiectasis and fibrosis and these were noted in 60\% of children, 71\% of adolescents and 76.9\% of adults. These changes were more common in right upper lobe in all age groups. There was no significant difference in the frequency of these changes (except nodules) in different age groups. Centrilobular nodules were seen less commonly in children less than 10 years (P = 0.028). Pleural effusion was noted in 28 (18.42\%) patients and pericardial effusion in 8 (5.3\%) patients. No significant difference in the serosal involvement is seen among children and adults. Mediastinal adenopathy was seen 70\% of children, 76.3\% adolescents and 76.9\% of adults and paratracheal nodes were seen most frequently. Nodes had similar features (except matting) among all age groups. Matting of nodes was seen more commonly in children (P = 0.014).
CONCLUSION: Pediatric chest tuberculosis can have severe parenchymal lesions and nodal involvement similar to adults. The destructive lung changes observed in children needs immediate attention in view of the longer life span they have and hence in formulating optimal treatment strategies.},

The article reviews the imaging findings in CTB on various modalities. We also attempt to categorize the findings into those definitive for active TB, indeterminate for disease activity, and those indicating healed TB. Though various radiological modalities are widely used in evaluation of such patients, no imaging guidelines exist for the use of these modalities in diagnosis and follow-up. Consequently, imaging is not optimally utilized and patients are often unnecessarily subjected to repeated CT examinations, which is undesirable. Based on the available literature and our experience, we propose certain recommendations delineating the role of imaging in the diagnosis and follow-up of such patients. The authors recognize that this is an evolving field and there may be future revisions depending on emergence of new evidence.},

Tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality among patients with HIV and poses a risk throughout the course of HIV disease, even after successful initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Progress in the implementation of activities directed at reducing TB burden in the HIV population lags far behind global targets. HIV programs designed for longitudinal care are ideally suited to implement TB control measures and have no option but to address TB vigorously to save patient lives, to safeguard the massive investment in HIV treatment, and to curb the global TB burden. We propose a framework of strategic actions for HIV care programs to optimally integrate TB into their services. The core activities of this framework include intensified TB case finding, treatment of TB, isoniazid preventive treatment, infection control, administration of ART, TB recording and reporting, and joint efforts of HIV and TB programs at the national and local levels.},

In this article, we discuss some cases where random forests may suffer and propose a novel generalized RF method, namely regression-enhanced random forests (RERFs), that can improve on RFs by borrowing the strength of penalized parametric regression. The algorithm for constructing RERFs and selecting its tuning parameters is described. Both simulation study and real data examples show that RERFs have better predictive performance than RFs in important situations often encountered in practice. Moreover, RERFs may incorporate known relationships between the response and the predictors, and may give reliable predictions in extrapolation problems where predictions are required at points out of the domain of the training dataset. Strategies analogous to those described here can be used to improve other machine learning methods via combination with penalized parametric regression techniques.},

	abstract = {Vaccine induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV remains a major challenge. Germline-targeting immunogens hold promise for initiating the induction of certain bnAb classes; yet for most bnAbs, a strong dependence on antibody heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) is a major barrier. Exploiting ultradeep human antibody sequencing data, we identified a diverse set of potential antibody precursors for a bnAb with dominant HCDR3 contacts. We then developed HIV envelope trimer–based immunogens that primed responses from rare bnAb-precursor B cells in a mouse model and bound a range of potential bnAb-precursor human naïve B cells in ex vivo screens. Our repertoire-guided germline-targeting approach provides a framework for priming the induction of many HIV bnAbs and could be applied to most HCDR3-dominant antibodies from other pathogens.},

This allows the solver to be used for establishing theoretical results and in applications where correct solutions are critical due to legal and financial consequences. Our solver is a hybrid symbolic/numeric implementation of LP-based branch-and-bound, using numerically-safe methods for all binding computations in the search tree. Computing provably accurate solutions by dynamically choosing the fastest of several safe dual bounding methods depending on the structure of the instance, our exact solver is only moderately slower than an inexact floating-point branch-and-bound solver. The software is incorporated into the SCIP optimization framework, using the exact LP  solver QSopt\_ex and the GMP arithmetic library. Computational results are presented for a suite of test instances taken from the Miplib and Mittelmann libraries and for a new collection of numerically difficult instances.},

In this survey paper, we describe a comprehensive paradigm for statistical inference on random dot product graphs, a paradigm centered on spectral embeddings of adjacency and Laplacian matrices. We examine the analogues, in graph inference, of several canonical tenets of classical Euclidean inference: in particular, we summarize a body of existing results on the consistency and asymptotic normality of the adjacency and Laplacian spectral embeddings, and the role these spectral embeddings can play in the construction of single- and multi-sample hypothesis tests for graph data. We investigate several real-world applications, including community detection and classification in large social networks and the determination of functional and biologically relevant network properties from an exploratory data analysis of the Drosophila connectome. We outline requisite background and current open problems in spectral graph inference.},

We assume that the edge weights and adjacencies in the network are conditionally independent and that both sources of information encode class membership information. In particular, we introduce a edge weight distribution matrix to the standard K-Block Stochastic Block Model to model weighted networks. This allows us to develop simple yet powerful extensions of classification techniques using the spectral embedding of the unweighted adjacency matrix. We consider two assumptions on the edge weight distributions and propose classification procedures in both settings. We show the effectiveness of the proposed classifiers by comparing them to quadratic discriminant analysis following the spectral embedding of a transformed weighted network. Moreover, we discuss and show how the methods perform when the edge weights do not encode class membership information.},

	abstract = {The random dot product graph (RDPG) is an independent-edge random graph that is analytically tractable and, simultaneously, either encompasses or can successfully approximate a wide range of random graphs, from relatively simple stochastic block models to complex latent position graphs. In this survey paper, we describe a comprehensive paradigm for statistical inference on random dot product graphs, a paradigm centered on spectral embeddings of adjacency and Laplacian matrices. We examine the analogues, in graph inference, of several canonical tenets of classical Euclidean inference: in particular, we summarize a body of existing results on the consistency and asymptotic normality of the adjacency and Laplacian spectral embeddings, and the role these spectral embeddings can play in the construction of single- and multi-sample hypothesis tests for graph data. We investigate several real-world applications, including community detection and classification in large social networks and the determination of functional and biologically relevant network properties from an exploratory data analysis of the Drosophila connectome. We outline requisite background and current open problems in spectral graph inference.},
